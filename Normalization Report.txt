Normalization Report

1NF (First Normal Form) 
- Data is organized into distinct tables: Books, Authors, Members, Book_Author, and Borrow.  
- All attributes are atomic, meaning there are no repeating groups.  


2NF (Second Normal Form)  
- Each table has a designated primary key.  
- All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key, with no partial dependencies present.  

3NF (Third Normal Form)
- There are no transitive dependencies; non-key attributes depend solely on the primary key.  
- For instance, in the Books table, the Publisher attribute depends only on BookID, not through another attribute.  


BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)  
- All functional dependencies have candidate keys on the left side.  
- ISBN in the Books table and Email in the Members table are unique, confirming their status as valid candidate keys.  

Conclusion  
The schema is fully normalized up to BCNF, which ensures minimal redundancy, robust data integrity, and efficient querying for books, authors, members, and borrowing records.
