# Task-1

I developed a Library Management Database to effectively manage books, authors, 
members, and borrowing records. The primary objectives were to minimize redundancy, 
maintain data integrity, and facilitate straightforward queries, 
such as “Which member borrowed which book?”

How It Works 
- Designed normalized tables: Books, Authors, Members, Borrow, and Book_Author.  
- Implemented BCNF to enhance efficiency and ensure data integrity.  
- Created an ER Diagram to illustrate the relationships among the entities.
