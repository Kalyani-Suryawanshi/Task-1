# Task-1

I built a Library Management Database to organize books, authors, members, and borrowing records.
The goal was to reduce redundancy, ensure data integrity, and make queries like “Which member borrowed which book?” easy.

🔧 How it Works

Designed normalized tables (Books, Authors, Members, Borrow, Book_Author).

Applied BCNF for efficiency and integrity.

Created an ER Diagram to visualize relationships.
